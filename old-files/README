These are old files that I don't use any more. Mostly from old versions of the tool. Feel free to delete.

Although they're not used, I'm keeping them around for reference or inspiration, since I did put
brain juice into them. However, if you decided to take this repo and use it for your own purposes,
do whatever you want with these files. It won't break the currently working version of the project if you dump them.
