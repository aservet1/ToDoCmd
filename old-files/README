These are old files that I don't use any more. Mostly from old versions of the tool.

They are currently useless to the actual functionality of the tool. You can delete this folder
if you want, or change the files or do literally anything and it won't affect the actual application.

Although they're not used, I'm keeping them around for reference or inspiration, since I did put
brain juice into them. However, if you decided to take this repo and use it for your own purposes,
do whatever you want with these files. It won't break the project if you dump them.
