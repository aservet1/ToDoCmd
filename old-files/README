These are old files from an old version that I started working on in winter 2019. They're
probably obsolete at this point since I have a new working version of the project but
I'm keeping them around in case they might be useful for some sort of reference. Anyone
who is using this code because they found my repo on the internet is more than welcome
to look through whatever they want of this, but know it's not currently being used in
the actual 'cmdtodo' application, so you can just delete this folder and everything in
it if you don't want to deal with any of this.
