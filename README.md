# cmdtodo
A command line ToDo list application.

Initially, I had a bunch of ToDos in text files throughout my computer. Then I decided to write a Bash script that
prints them all in one place so I can see all of it. I kept adding features to the script to make the process more user friendly
and it evantually became a command line to do list application.

## Features
...

## Dependencies
Unix system that can run Bash scripts.
