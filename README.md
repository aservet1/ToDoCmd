# cmdtodo
A command line ToDo list application.

Initially, I had a bunch of ToDos in text files throughout my computer. Then I decided to write a Bash script that goes through
all of them and prints their cotents to one main file. I kept adding features to the script to make the process more user friendly
and it evantually became a command line to do list application.

This project was not only made as a way to organize my ToDos, but also a way to learn Bash scripting and how to work in the Unix environment,
as I had started as a Linux newbie from Windows only two months before.

## Features
...

## Dependencies
Unix system that can run Bash scripts.

## Things I need to add
- The file paths are absolute to my computer
- Need to make a global configuration file (for file paths and preferred text editor and stuff like that)
- Install and uninstall scripts
- Make it convert to groff or troff or nroff or whatever simple PDF syntax
